# Live View

Live View renders components on the server and pushes updates over a WebSocket. Build interactive UIs without writing JavaScript: state lives on the server, events flow over the wire, and the client **morphs the DOM in place** to match the new render — nodes are updated, not replaced, so focus, caret position, and client-side widget state survive updates (see [How patches reach the DOM](#how-patches-reach-the-dom)).

## How It Works

1. The browser opens a WebSocket to `/live/socket/<component>`.
2. The server renders the initial HTML and sends it down.
3. User interactions (click, submit, change, …) post events back over the socket.
4. The server invokes your handler, computes new state, re-renders, and ships a patch for the changed region.

## Creating a Live View Component

### Step 1 — Template

Create a template in `app/views/live/` (`.html.slv`; `.slv`, `.sliv`, and `.html.erb` also resolve). State is interpolated with standard ERB tags.

```html
<!-- app/views/live/counter.html.slv -->
<div class="counter-component">
  <h2>Count: <%= count %></h2>

  <button soli-click="decrement">-</button>
  <button soli-click="increment">+</button>
</div>
```

### Step 2 — Route

Register the component with `router_live(component_name, controller#action)`:

```soli
# config/routes.sl
router_live("counter", "live#counter");
```

The first argument is the **component name** (the segment in `/live/socket/<component>` and the template filename), not a URL path.

### Step 3 — Controller

A Live View handler takes one argument — an event hash with `event`, `params`, and `state` — and returns the new state.

```soli
# app/controllers/live_controller.sl
def counter(event_data: Any) -> Any {
  event = event_data["event"]   # e.g. "increment", "connect", "tick"
  state = event_data["state"]   # current component state
  count = state["count"] || 0

  if event == "increment"
    { "count": count + 1 }
  elsif event == "decrement"
    { "count": count - 1 }
  else
    state                       # unchanged for unknown events
  end
}
```

## Available Directives

| Directive | Triggers on |
|-----------|------------|
| `soli-click` | Element click |
| `soli-submit` | Form submission |
| `soli-change` | Input value change |
| `soli-keydown` | Key press |
| `soli-keyup` | Key release |
| `soli-focus` | Element gains focus |
| `soli-blur` | Element loses focus |
| `soli-value-*` | Binds input value into state |
| `soli-target` | Specifies target component for updates |

Two more attributes control how the DOM morph treats an element (they trigger nothing on the server):

| Attribute | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `soli-key` | Identity for list items: a reordered element with the same key keeps its DOM node (and its focus/widget state) instead of being rebuilt. Falls back to `id` when absent. |
| `soli-ignore` | Marks a subtree as client-owned: the element's own attributes stay server-driven, but its children are never touched by a patch. Put Alpine islands, charts, and other third-party widgets here. |

## Template Variables

State keys are available in the template as plain ERB variables:

```html
<!-- Simple variable -->
<span>Hello, <%= username %></span>

<!-- Conditional rendering -->
<% if logged_in %>
  <a href="/logout">Sign Out</a>
<% else %>
  <a href="/login">Sign In</a>
<% end %>

<!-- Iteration -->
<% for item in items %>
  <li><%= item["name"] %></li>
<% end %>
```

## Client Setup

The client is served by the soli binary itself at `/live/client.js` — no file to vendor, and it is always in sync with the server's patch protocol. Include it only on pages that mount a live component — it is ~7 KB gzipped (~30 KB raw) and auto-connects every `[data-liveview-url]` element on `DOMContentLoaded`:

```html
<!-- Include the Live View client (built into the binary, ~7 KB gzipped) -->
<script src="/live/client.js"></script>

<!-- Mount a Live View component (auto-connects on page load) -->
<div data-live-root data-liveview-url="/live/socket/counter"></div>
```

To control connection timing yourself (e.g. after a client-side navigation that doesn't re-fire `DOMContentLoaded`), add `data-liveview-manual` to skip auto-connect and call `live()` by hand:

```html
<div data-live-root data-liveview-manual data-liveview-url="/live/socket/counter"></div>

<script>
  window.live("wss://example.com/live/socket/counter", { rootElement: document.querySelector("[data-live-root]") });
</script>
```

## How Patches Reach the DOM

When state changes, the server re-renders the template and diffs the new HTML against the previous render, shipping a compact positional patch (just the changed lines) over the socket. The client keeps a shadow copy of the exact HTML it last received, applies the patch to it, then **morphs** the live region's real DOM to match:

- Nodes are mutated in place — attributes synced, text updated — instead of being torn down and rebuilt, so `document.activeElement`, caret/selection position, and scroll state survive.
- Form fields follow a "user wins" rule: a focused field is never clobbered (typing that round-trips through `soli-change` can't lose in-flight keystrokes), and an unfocused field only changes when the server *actually changes* the rendered `value` attribute (checkboxes and selects behave the same way for `checked`/`selected`).
- List items with `soli-key` (or an `id`) keep their DOM node across reorders.
- Subtrees under `soli-ignore` are never touched — the home for Alpine widgets, charts, maps.
- The server owns everything else: DOM your own JS inserts *outside* a `soli-ignore` subtree is removed on the next patch, and `<script>` tags patched into a live region never execute.

If the client ever fails to apply a patch (lost shadow, version skew), it asks the server to replay the last full render — recovery is automatic and keeps server-side state intact.

## Lifecycle Events

Two synthetic events are dispatched by the server in addition to user-driven directives:

- `connect` — fired once, immediately after the WebSocket is established and before any client events. Use it to seed initial state and (optionally) start a tick timer.
- `tick` — fired on a recurring interval requested by the handler (see below). Use it for server-pushed updates like dashboards or live charts.

## High-Rate Updates with Ticks

For real-time dashboards, monitoring, and live data feeds, a handler can opt into a per-instance recurring tick. Return the **wrapped form** `{ "state": {...}, "tick_interval": <ms> }` from any handler invocation:

> **Live demo.** A tick-driven server clock runs live on the [LiveView docs page](/docs/core-concepts/liveview) — it's this site's own `live#metrics` handler pushing ~20 diffs a second.

```soli
# app/controllers/live_controller.sl
def metrics_dashboard(event_data: Any) -> Any {
  event = event_data["event"]

  if event == "connect"
    # Start ticking at 50ms (20 updates/sec)
    {
      "state": { "cpu": 0, "memory": 0, "requests": 0 },
      "tick_interval": 50
    }
  elsif event == "tick"
    # Server pushes fresh data on each tick
    {
      "state": {
        "time": datetime_now(),
        "cpu": system_cpu_usage(),
        "memory": system_memory_mb(),
        "requests": request_counter
      }
    }
  else
    # Unknown event — leave state and tick interval unchanged
    event_data["state"]
  end
}
```

### `tick_interval` semantics

| Returned value | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| key absent | Leave the running tick alone |
| `0` | Stop the tick |
| `> 0` | Start (or replace) the tick at this interval, in milliseconds |

The handler may return either shape on any invocation:

- **Bare:** `{ ...state }` — the whole hash is the new state. Equivalent to `tick_interval` absent.
- **Wrapped:** `{ "state": {...}, "tick_interval": N }` — `state` is the new state; `tick_interval` controls the timer.

If you return the bare form on a tick, the timer keeps running at its previous interval. To stop the timer, return `{ "state": {...}, "tick_interval": 0 }`.

### Recommended intervals

| Interval | Use case |
|----------|----------|
| `1000ms` | Dashboards, status pages |
| `100ms` | Live charts, activity feeds |
| `50ms` (20/s) | Real-time monitoring |
| `16ms` (60/s) | Animations — use sparingly |

If a tick fires while the previous handler call is still running, the tick is dropped (rather than queued) so a slow handler doesn't snowball. Ticks stop automatically when the WebSocket closes.

## Current limitations

Live View is young. Server-pushed re-renders and DOM-aware patching work well; some edges remain:

- **The wire format is line-granular, not node-granular.** The server ships the changed lines of the render (the client's morph is what makes the update DOM-aware); Phoenix-style static/dynamic splitting, which ships only the changed *values*, is not implemented. Fine in practice — renders are compared server-side and only the delta travels.
- **The directive set is a subset of Phoenix's.** Click, submit, change, keydown/keyup, focus/blur, `soli-value-*`, and `soli-target` — there is no debounce/throttle, no window-level bindings, no JS commands, no uploads, streams, or nested live components.
- **Scripts don't run on patch.** `<script>` tags inside a live region never execute when patched in; put behavior in external JS or an Alpine island under `soli-ignore`.
- **Reconnects re-mount.** If the socket drops, the client reconnects with backoff, but the component restarts from its initial state — in-flight state is not restored.
- **Per-process.** Instances live in server memory; multi-instance deployments need their own pub/sub layer to coordinate.

## Why Live View?

- **No JavaScript required** — build interactive UIs entirely in server-side code.
- **SEO friendly** — initial HTML is server-rendered.
- **Reduced complexity** — no client-side state management to maintain.
- **Real-time by default** — the WebSocket connection enables instant updates and server-pushed ticks.
