# Authorization & Policies

Soli ships a Pundit-style **policy layer** for authorization, scaffolded by
`soli generate auth` alongside session-based authentication. A policy answers
one question: *is the current user allowed to perform this action on this
record?*

## Generate it

```bash
soli generate auth
```

This writes a `User` model, the full Devise-style auth suite, and the policy
layer:

- Login/signup/logout controllers and views, plus a `load_current_user`
  middleware (which also honors remember-me cookies).
- **Password reset** (`/password/reset`): hashed one-time tokens, 2-hour
  expiry, no account enumeration, emailed via the scaffolded `AuthMailer`.
- **Email confirmation** (`/confirm_email`, `/confirmation/resend`): sent on
  signup; enforcement is a one-line toggle (`auth_require_confirmed_email`
  in `app/models/user.sl`, off by default so the flow works before SMTP is
  configured).
- **Remember-me**: an HttpOnly persistent cookie carrying a digest-stored
  token, promoted to a fresh session by the middleware.
- **Account lockout**: 10 failed logins lock the account for 30 minutes
  (auto-unlock); thresholds are constants at the top of the User model.
- `app/policies/application_policy.sl` — the `ApplicationPolicy` base class plus
  the global `authorize` / `policy_for` / `current_user` / `signed_in?` helpers.
- `app/policies/user_policy.sl` — a worked example policy.
- `app/helpers/auth_helper.sl` — `current_user` / `signed_in?` for views.

Configure SMTP (`SOLI_SMTP_*` env vars) so the reset/confirmation emails go
out — or `SOLI_MAIL_DELIVERY_METHOD=logger` in dev to print them to the
console — and set your production URL in `auth_base_url`
(`app/models/user.sl`).

Files in `app/policies/` are auto-loaded into the global scope at boot, like
models. **Restart the server after adding a new policy.**

## Writing a policy

A policy is a class named `<Model>Policy` that extends `ApplicationPolicy`, with
one predicate method per action: `index?`, `show?`, `create?`, `new?`,
`update?`, `edit?`, `destroy?`. Inside a policy, `this.user` is the current user
and `this.record` is the record being checked.

```soli
class PostPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def show?
    true                                    # anyone may read a post
  end

  def update?
    return false unless this.signed_in?()   # guard the nil user first

    return this.user["_key"] == this.record["author_id"]
  end

  def destroy?
    return this.update?()                   # same rule as update
  end
end
```

Policies **default to deny** — `ApplicationPolicy` returns `false` for every
predicate, so you only override what you want to allow. `new?` falls back to
`create?` and `edit?` falls back to `update?` unless you override them.

## Authorizing in a controller

Call `authorize(record)` at the top of an action. It looks up the matching
policy, builds it with the current user and record, and calls the predicate for
the **current action**. A falsey result raises a `403 Forbidden`; otherwise it
returns the record.

```soli
class PostsController < Controller
  def update
    post = Post.find(params["id"])
    authorize(post)                          # 403 unless PostPolicy#update? is true
    post.update(this._permit_params(params))
    return redirect(post_path(post))
  end
end
```

Pass an explicit action when it differs from the controller action:

```soli
authorize(post, "show")
```

A record class with **no** matching policy is denied (403), so a forgotten
policy fails closed rather than open.

## Helpers

| Helper | Scope | Returns |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `authorize(record, action?)` | controllers / policies | the record, or raises 403 |
| `policy_for(record)` | controllers / policies | the policy instance for `record` |
| `current_user()` | controllers / policies / views | the signed-in `User`, or `nil` |
| `signed_in?()` | controllers / policies / views | `true` when a user is signed in |
| `current_action()` | anywhere | the in-flight action name (`"update"`, …) |
| `forbidden(message?)` | anywhere | raises a `403 Forbidden` immediately |

`current_user` is populated per request by the `load_current_user` middleware,
which reads the user id from the session and loads the `User` record.

## Gating whole sections

Use `forbidden()` directly for coarse checks that aren't tied to a record:

```soli
def admin_dashboard
  forbidden("Admins only") unless current_user()&.admin?()
  return render("admin/dashboard")
end
```

## Custom 403 page

A denied request is rendered through the standard production error pipeline, so
you can ship a custom `app/views/errors/403.html.slv` and it will be used
automatically — the same mechanism as the `404` page.
