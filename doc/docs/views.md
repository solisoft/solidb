# Views

Views handle the presentation layer of your application.

## Template Syntax

SoliLang uses ERB-style templates. Tag types:

| Tag | Output | When to use |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `<%= expr %>` | HTML-escaped | **Default.** Anything that came from user input, the database, params, etc. |
| `<%- expr %>` | Raw, unescaped | Trusted HTML you've already produced — partials, `Markdown.to_safe_html(...)` output, `partial(...)` results. |
| `<% stmt %>` | No output | Statements, control flow, `let` bindings. |
| `<%= yield %>` | Layout insertion | Only valid inside a layout — marks where rendered content is spliced in. |
| `<%= yield "name" %>` | Named content | Splices content captured by a `content_for "name"` block. Empty when nothing was captured. |
| `<% content_for "name" do %> … <% end %>` | Nothing (captured) | Push a named block from a view/partial into the layout — per-page `<head>` scripts, sidebars, etc. |
| `<%# comment %>` | Nothing (stripped) | Developer comments — never sent to the browser. Single-line and multi-line both work. |

> `<%== expr %>` was removed (SEC-023). It decoded HTML entities and emitted the result raw, which silently re-created `<script>` from `&lt;script&gt;` whenever a value had been round-tripped through escape-encoded storage. Use `<%= html_unescape(expr) %>` for entity-decoded but escaped output, or `<%- expr %>` for trusted raw HTML.

### Output Variables

```erb
<h1><%= title %></h1>
<p>Hello, <%= name %>!</p>
<p>Count: <%= count %></p>
```

```erb
<!-- Raw output: skip escaping (only for HTML you trust) -->
<article><%- rendered_markdown %></article>
<%- partial("shared/nav") %>
```

For user-generated Markdown, render with `Markdown.to_safe_html(...)` before using raw output.

Controller instance fields are exposed as bare locals, but you can also reference them with the same `@` prefix you used in the controller — in a view, `<%= @title %>` falls back to the `title` local, so both forms render the same value. This works through member access and method calls too (`<%= @user.name %>`, `<%= @comments.length %>`). An `@`-name with no matching local renders as empty (`nil`), like any other absent template local.

```erb
<h1><%= @title %></h1>   <!-- mirrors the controller -->
<h1><%= title %></h1>    <!-- bare local, identical result -->
```

### Control Flow

```erb
<% if user_logged_in %>
  <p>Welcome back!</p>
<% else %>
  <p>Please log in.</p>
<% end %>

<% for item in items %>
  <li><%= item.name %></li>
<% end %>

<% if count > 0 %>
  <p>You have <%= count %> items.</p>
<% end %>
```

### Helper Functions

Templates have access to several built-in helper functions:

```erb
<%= h(user_input) %>          <!-- HTML escape -->
<%= html_escape(content) %>   <!-- Same as h() -->
```

## Template Helper Functions

The following helper functions are automatically available in all templates.

### Utility Functions

#### range(start, end)

Creates an array of numbers for iteration.

```erb
<% for i in range(1, 5) %>
  <p>Item <%= i %></p>
<% end %>
```

#### public_path(path)

Returns a versioned public asset path with cache-busting hash.

```erb
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<%= public_path("css/app.css") %>">
<script src="<%= public_path("js/app.js") %>"></script>
```

Output: `/css/app.css?v=a1b2c3d4...`

### HTML Functions

#### html_escape(string) / h(string)

Escapes HTML special characters to prevent XSS attacks. Use `h()` for content embedded in element bodies (between tags).

```erb
<p><%= html_escape(user_input) %></p>
<p><%= h(user_input) %></p>
```

#### attr(string)

Escapes a string for safe interpolation inside an HTML attribute value (between quotes). Encodes `"`, `'`, `<`, `>`, and `&`. Use this — not `h()` — when interpolating into attributes, since attribute context allows unquoted/single-quoted values that `h()` does not cover.

```erb
<a title="<%= attr(post.title) %>">Read</a>
<input value="<%= attr(form_value) %>">
```

#### j(string)

JavaScript-string escape for embedding inside an inline `<script>` block. Escapes backslashes, single/double quotes, and `<`/`>`/`&` so a payload cannot break out of the string literal or close the surrounding `</script>` tag.

```erb
<script>
  const user = "<%= j(current_user.name) %>";
  const next = "<%= j(redirect_url) %>";
</script>
```

#### url(string)

Percent-encodes a string for safe use as a URL query-parameter value or path segment. Only unreserved characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_`, `.`, `~`) are passed through; everything else is `%`-encoded.

```erb
<a href="/search?q=<%= url(query) %>">Search</a>
<a href="/users/<%= url(user.slug) %>">Profile</a>
```

> **Pick the helper that matches the output context.** `h()` is for element bodies, `attr()` for attribute values, `j()` for JS string literals, `url()` for URL query/path parts. Using the wrong one — e.g. `h()` inside a `<script>` — leaves XSS gaps.

#### html_unescape(string)

Unescapes HTML entities back to their original characters.

```erb
<%= html_unescape("&lt;p&gt;") %>  <!-- Output: <p> -->
```

#### strip_html(string)

Removes all HTML tags from a string.

```erb
<%= strip_html("<p>Hello <b>World</b></p>") %>  <!-- Output: Hello World -->
```

#### sanitize_html(string)

Removes dangerous HTML tags and attributes while preserving safe content.

```erb
<%= sanitize_html(user_content) %>
```

#### substring(string, start, end)

Extracts a portion of a string (useful for truncating content).

```erb
<%= substring(post["content"], 0, 100) %>...
```

### Request-Context Functions

Read fields off the current request directly — no need to plumb them through the view data hash. Available in every template (views, layouts, partials). They return `null` when called outside an active request (e.g. from a unit test).

| Helper              | Returns                                                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `current_path()`    | Request pathname, e.g. `"/users"`. `null` outside a request.         |
| `current_method()`  | HTTP method, e.g. `"GET"`. `null` outside a request.                 |
| `current_path?(p)`  | `true` if the current path equals `p` exactly. Use for active links. |

**Active-link pattern:**

```erb
<nav>
  <a href="/users" class="<%= current_path?("/users") ? "active" : "" %>">Users</a>
  <a href="/posts" class="<%= current_path?("/posts") ? "active" : "" %>">Posts</a>
</nav>

<p>You are viewing <%= current_path() %> (<%= current_method() %>).</p>
```

For prefix matches (e.g. any path under `/users`), compose with `current_path().starts_with("/users")`.

### Hover Preload

Soli auto-injects a small `<script>` tag into every HTML response that listens for `mouseover` on links and adds a `<link rel="prefetch" as="document">` so the browser warms its document-prefetch cache before the user clicks. The script is served at `/__soli/prefetch.js` — an external file, not inline, so apps with strict CSP (no `unsafe-inline`) work out of the box. Browsers send these requests with a `Sec-Purpose: prefetch` header (older browsers `Purpose: prefetch`), so your backend can log or differentiate them.

**What you get for free:**

- Same-origin GET links only; cross-origin, `mailto:`, `tel:`, and in-page `#fragment` links are skipped.
- 65 ms hover debounce so fly-over hovers don't waste bandwidth.
- Skipped on `navigator.connection.saveData` or 2G networks.
- Each URL prefetched at most once per page load.
- Works on touch devices: `touchstart` triggers an immediate prefetch (strong intent).

**Opt out per link:**

```erb
<a href="/heavy-report" data-no-prefetch>Heavy Report</a>

<!-- Or on a container to cover everything inside -->
<section data-no-prefetch>
  <a href="/a">A</a>
  <a href="/b">B</a>
</section>
```

Also skipped: `<a data-method="post">` (Rails-style non-GET link helpers).

**Opt out globally:**

```bash
SOLI_PREFETCH=off soli serve .
```

`off`, `false`, `0`, and `no` all disable. Anything else (or unset) keeps it on.

**Caching defaults:** every HTML response from a controller — whether you call `render(...)` explicitly or let an OOP controller action auto-render its matching view — carries two headers automatically so the prefetch actually delivers instant navigation:

- **`ETag: W/"<16-hex>"`** — a content-derived *weak* validator (FNV-1a over the rendered body, computed after live-reload/prefetch script injection so it reflects the exact bytes on the wire). Weak, not strong, so it survives the content-encoding transforms a CDN applies (Cloudflare and friends strip strong ETags when they re-compress; weak ones pass through).
- **`Cache-Control: private, no-cache`** — the browser may cache, shared caches (CDN, reverse proxy) may not; the entry must be revalidated before reuse.

On the actual click, the browser sends `If-None-Match: W/"<etag>"`. If the rendered body would be identical, the framework short-circuits to **`304 Not Modified`** with just the validator headers — no body re-transmission. Result: the prefetched body is consumed as the navigation response, so the click feels instant.

**Behind a CDN (Cloudflare, etc.):** that `304` round-trip only works if the conditional `GET` reaches the origin. Some edge configurations don't relay it — a "Cache Everything" rule, edge revalidation, or HTML-transform features (Rocket Loader, Email Obfuscation, Mirage) that need the full body — so the click re-downloads the whole page and the prefetch is wasted. To make the feature robust regardless of edge config, Soli detects the `Sec-Purpose: prefetch` request and answers it with **`Cache-Control: private, max-age=30`** instead of `no-cache`. The prefetched HTML is then *fresh* in the browser's own (private) cache for a short window, so the click reuses it directly — **no conditional GET, so the CDN never gets a vote.** Normal navigations are unaffected: they don't carry the prefetch header, so they still get `private, no-cache`. Tune the window with `SOLI_PREFETCH_TTL` (seconds, clamped 1–300; default 30), or set it low if your pages change second-to-second.

> If your CDN rewrites `Cache-Control` for the browser (Cloudflare's **Browser Cache TTL** set to anything other than *Respect Existing Headers*), it can override this `max-age`. Leave Browser Cache TTL on *Respect Existing Headers* for the app hostname.

**Override per response** when the defaults don't fit. Set your own `Cache-Control` (and optionally `ETag`) in the response headers and the framework defaults step aside:

```soli
def downloads
  # One-shot download — never reuse; always re-fetch.
  return {
    "status": 200,
    "headers": {"Cache-Control": "no-store", "Content-Type": "text/csv"},
    "body": csv_bytes
  }
end
```

**Gotchas:**

- **`Cache-Control: no-store`** (explicit, in your response) disables the cache entirely — prefetch still fires but the browser re-fetches on click. Use for sensitive one-shot pages.
- **POST/PUT/DELETE responses** aren't cached regardless, so nothing special is needed there.
- Per-request **`Set-Cookie`** headers (flash messages, CSRF token rotation) can cause some browsers to ignore the cache entry even with good `Cache-Control`. In that case the prefetch still warms the TCP/TLS connection and any server-side caches, so the click is at least faster.

### Instant Navigation

On top of hover preloading, Soli auto-injects an instant-navigation script (served at `/__soli/nav.js`) into every HTML response. It intercepts same-origin link clicks, fetches the target page in the background, and **swaps `<body>` in place** — merging the new page's `<title>`, stylesheets, and `meta` tags — while managing the URL bar with `pushState`. The result is Turbo-Drive-style navigation: your CSS and JS stay loaded, Alpine and htmx stay booted, and clicks render near-instantly, all while the app remains plain server-rendered HTML.

When instant navigation is on, it **takes over hover prefetching**: a JavaScript `fetch()` can't consume `<link rel="prefetch">` entries (browser cache partitioning), so `nav.js` prefetches hovered links into its own in-memory cache with the same ergonomics (65 ms debounce, `touchstart`, `data-no-prefetch`, save-data/2G skip). Its prefetch requests carry `Purpose: prefetch`, so all the [Hover Preload](#hover-preload) caching machinery — `SOLI_PREFETCH_TTL`, the ETag/304 revalidation, the CDN notes — applies unchanged. `SOLI_PREFETCH=off` disables the hover warming without disabling click swapping.

**Which clicks are intercepted?** Only plain left-clicks on same-origin GET links. Everything else falls through to the browser:

- Modifier keys (`Cmd`/`Ctrl`/`Shift`/`Alt` — open-in-new-tab intent), middle/right clicks.
- Cross-origin links, `mailto:`/`tel:`/`javascript:`, `target="_blank"` (any target ≠ `_self`), `download` links.
- `<a data-method="post">` and friends (non-GET link helpers).
- Links carrying any `hx-*`/`data-hx-*` attribute or inside `[hx-boost]` — htmx owns those.
- Anything that already called `preventDefault()` (Alpine `@click.prevent`, your own handlers).
- Same-page `#fragment` links (native anchor scroll).

**Opt out:**

```erb
<!-- Per link, or per container -->
<a href="/legacy-page" data-no-nav>Legacy page</a>
<section data-no-nav> ... </section>

<!-- Per page (both the current page and any page navigated to) -->
<meta name="soli-nav" content="off">
```

```bash
# Globally — restores plain hover preloading (prefetch.js)
SOLI_NAV=off soli serve .
```

**Lifecycle events** fire on `document` so you can hook in:

| Event | Cancelable | When |
|-------|-----------|------|
| `soli:visit` | yes — cancel to force a full navigation | Before a visit starts; `detail.url` |
| `soli:before-render` | yes — cancel to force a full navigation | After fetch, before the swap; `detail.newDocument` |
| `soli:load` | no | After every swap — the re-initialization hook |

**`DOMContentLoaded` keeps working.** The event itself fires once per document and never again after a swap — but inline scripts re-executed by a visit routinely register `DOMContentLoaded`/`load` listeners, so the framework *replays* them: once the event has already fired, registering a listener for it invokes the listener immediately (the same semantics as jQuery's `.ready()`). Your existing init code — sliders, lightboxes, anything wrapped in `DOMContentLoaded` — works after swaps without changes. The same replay covers `alpine:init`/`alpine:initialized`: a page-specific bundle first executed by a swap that registers components with `document.addEventListener("alpine:init", () => Alpine.data(...))` works unchanged. For code in **external** scripts (which execute once per tab, not per visit), hook `soli:load` to re-initialize per navigation:

```html
<script>
  function initWidgets() { /* ... */ }
  document.addEventListener("soli:load", initWidgets);  // fires after every swap
  initWidgets();                                        // first full load
</script>
```

**Script semantics after a swap:** inline `<script>` tags in the new body re-execute on every visit (that's what page-specific init wants). External `<script src>` tags execute **once per URL** for the lifetime of the browser tab — so `alpine.min.js` and `htmx.min.js` in your layout never double-evaluate. Scripts run **sequentially in document order**, each external awaited before the next script executes — the same guarantee the parser gives on a full load, so an inline `tailwind.config = {...}` right after the Tailwind CDN script still finds `tailwind` defined. Only after the whole chain settles does the framework call `Alpine.initTree(document.body)` and `htmx.process(document.body)` — so Alpine components whose `x-data` scope is registered by a page-specific bundle initialize correctly, and `hx-*` attributes in the new body just work.

**Persistent elements (`data-soli-permanent`):** the body swap tears down the old DOM and builds the new page fresh — fine for server-rendered content, but it destroys live client-side widgets that aren't reflected in the server HTML (a map with its rendered tiles, a playing `<video>`, a rich-text editor with unsaved state). Tag such an element with `data-soli-permanent` and an `id`, and the framework lifts the **live** element out of the old body and grafts it over the matching placeholder in the new one — untouched, never reparsed — so the widget keeps running across the navigation with no teardown, no re-initialization, no flicker:

```erb
<div id="gather-map" data-soli-permanent></div>
```

The element persists only between pages that **both** declare it (same `id` + `data-soli-permanent`); navigate to a page without the matching placeholder and it's discarded with the old body. Any inline `<script>` *inside* a permanent element is carried over live and is **not** re-executed on the swap (it already ran). This is the right tool when re-initializing on `soli:load` would mean an expensive rebuild — prefer it over the re-init hook for maps and media players.

**History and scrolling:** back/forward are handled via `popstate` with a refetch — which the ETag machinery answers with a cheap `304`, served from the browser's HTTP cache. Scroll position is restored on back-navigation; forward visits scroll to the top (or to the `#fragment` target if the link had one).

**View Transitions (opt-in):** add the same meta tag Turbo uses and swaps animate with the [View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) in supporting browsers:

```html
<meta name="view-transition" content="same-origin">
```

**Graceful degradation:** non-HTML responses (downloads, JSON), fetch failures, and redirects that leave the origin all fall back to a normal full navigation automatically. (Alpine `x-teleport` pages swap fine — the swap destroys the old Alpine tree, which runs each teleport's cleanup, before replacing the body and re-initializing.) Error pages (404/500) that render HTML are swapped in like any other page, with the URL updated to the final response URL.

## Application Helpers

When you create a new application with `soli new`, a starter helper file is generated at `app/helpers/application_helper.sl`. These helpers complement the built-in functions and are automatically available in all templates.

### truncate(text, length, suffix)

Truncates text to a maximum length, appending a suffix (default: "...").

**Parameters:**
- `text` (String) - The text to truncate
- `length` (Int) - Maximum length before truncation
- `suffix` (String, optional) - Suffix to append (default: "...")

```erb
<p><%= truncate(post["content"], 100) %></p>
<!-- "This is a very long article that continues..." -->

<p><%= truncate(title, 50, " [more]") %></p>
<!-- "This is a long title that gets cut [more]" -->
```

### number_with_delimiter(number, delimiter)

Formats a number with thousands separators. Locale-aware by default.

**Parameters:**
- `number` (Int|Float) - The number to format
- `delimiter` (String, optional) - The separator character (auto-detected from locale if not specified)

```erb
<p>Views: <%= number_with_delimiter(1234567) %></p>
<!-- en: "1,234,567" | fr: "1 234 567" | de: "1.234.567" -->

<p>Population: <%= number_with_delimiter(population) %></p>

<!-- Override with specific delimiter -->
<p>Custom: <%= number_with_delimiter(1234567, "'") %></p>
<!-- "1'234'567" -->
```

### currency(amount, symbol)

Formats a number as currency. Locale-aware by default - automatically uses the correct symbol, delimiter, and symbol position for the current locale.

**Parameters:**
- `amount` (Int|Float) - The amount to format
- `symbol` (String, optional) - Currency symbol (auto-detected from locale if not specified)

### Customizing Application Helpers

You can add your own helpers by editing `app/helpers/application_helper.sl`:

```soli
# app/helpers/application_helper.sl

# ... existing helpers ...

# Custom helper: Format a phone number
def format_phone(number)
  digits = replace(number, "[^0-9]", "")
  if len(digits) == 10
    return "(" + substring(digits, 0, 3) + ") " + substring(digits, 3, 6) + "-" + substring(digits, 6, 10)
  end
  number
end

# Custom helper: Generate a mailto link
def mail_to(email, text = null)
  if text == null
    text = email
  end
  "<a href=\"mailto:" + html_escape(email) + "\">" + html_escape(text) + "</a>"
end
```

## Layouts

Wrap views in a common layout:

```erb
<!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.slv -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title><%= title %></title>
</head>
<body>
  <nav>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
  </nav>

  <main>
    <%= yield %>
  </main>

  <footer>
    &copy; 2024 My App
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Use layout with render:

```soli
def index
  render("home/index", {
    "title": "Welcome"
  }, "layouts/application")
end
```

## Named Content with `content_for`

A plain `<%= yield %>` gives the layout exactly one insertion point. When a
page needs to inject content *elsewhere* in the layout — a page-specific
`<script>` in the `<head>`, a sidebar, extra meta tags — capture it in the
view with `content_for` and read it back in the layout with a named `yield`:

```erb
<!-- app/views/reports/show.html.slv -->
<% content_for "head" do %>
  <script src="/js/chart.js"></script>
<% end %>

<h1><%= report.title %></h1>
```

```erb
<!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.slv -->
<html>
<head>
  <title><%= title %></title>
  <%= yield "head" %>
</head>
<body>
  <%= yield %>
</body>
</html>
```

Semantics:

- **Views and partials can capture.** A `content_for` block inside a partial
  registers into the same store as the view that rendered it.
- **Repeated captures append.** Two `content_for "head"` blocks concatenate
  in document order (Rails semantics).
- **Missing names render empty.** `<%= yield "head" %>` emits nothing when no
  view captured `"head"` — no guard needed, no error.
- **No double-escaping.** The captured fragment is already-rendered template
  output: interpolations inside the block were escaped at capture time, and
  the named `yield` splices the result raw — exactly like the main `yield`.
- **Names are string literals** (`"head"` or `'head'`), so the layout's
  insertion points are known at parse time.

`content_for("name")` also works as a read-form in the layout, equivalent to
`yield "name"`:

```erb
<%= content_for("head") %>
```

To wrap a section in markup only when something was captured, use the
`content_for?` predicate:

```erb
<% if content_for?("sidebar") %>
  <aside class="sidebar">
    <%= yield "sidebar" %>
  </aside>
<% end %>
```

`content_for?("name")` returns `true` only when a non-empty capture exists
for that name.

## Partials

Reuse template fragments:

```erb
<!-- app/views/partials/user_card.html.slv -->
<div class="user-card">
  <h3><%= user.name %></h3>
  <p><%= user.email %></p>
</div>
```

Include partials — use `partial(...)` as the short alias for `render_partial(...)`:

```erb
<%= partial("partials/user_card", {"user": current_user}) %>

<% for user in users %>
  <%= partial("partials/user_card", {"user": user}) %>
<% end %>

<!-- render_partial(...) still works and is identical -->
<%= render_partial("partials/user_card", {"user": current_user}) %>
```

### The `locals` hash

Partials expose their entire context hash as a `locals` variable, mirroring
Rails' `local_assigns`. You don't need this for everyday partials — bare
identifiers work and read better:

```erb
<!-- Caller -->
<%= partial("user_card", {"user": current_user, "size": "lg"}) %>

<!-- Inside the partial -->
<div class="user-card user-card--<%= size %>">
  <h3><%= user.name %></h3>
</div>
```

Reach for `locals[...]` when a key would collide with a reserved word or a
builtin function. For example, `class` is reserved and bare `class` fails to
parse; `type` is a global builtin, so bare `type` resolves to the function
and auto-calls with zero args. In both cases, bracket access returns the
string the caller passed:

```erb
<!-- Caller -->
<%= partial("shared/icon", {"name": "bell", "class": "h-6 w-6"}) %>

<!-- Inside shared/_icon.html.slv -->
<svg class="<%= locals["class"] %>" data-icon="<%= name %>">…</svg>
```

Missing keys return `null`, so the usual `.nil?` pattern applies without
guards:

```erb
<% let css = locals["class"].nil? ? "h-5 w-5" : locals["class"] %>
```

`locals` is always defined, even when the partial is rendered without a
data hash — in that case it's an empty hash, so `locals[anything]` is safe
and returns `null`.

## Passing Data

Controllers pass data to views:

```soli
def show
  render("posts/show", {
    "title": "My Post",
    "post": post,
    "comments": comments,
    "author": author
  })
end
```

Access in template:

```erb
<h1><%= post.title %></h1>
<div class="content"><%= post.content %></div>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<% for comment in comments %>
  <div class="comment">
    <strong><%= comment.author %></strong>
    <p><%= comment.text %></p>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

## View Best Practices

1. Keep views simple and focused on presentation
2. Use partials for repeated elements
3. Never put business logic in views
4. Use helper functions for complex formatting
5. Escape user-generated content with `h()`
